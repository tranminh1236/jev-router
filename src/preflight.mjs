 * all, to check the bounding and corruption-handling behavior in isolation.
 *
 * A map, not a list, trimmed from the front: insertion order in a plain object is already
 * "oldest first" for keys nothing has touched since, so dropping `Object.keys(map).length - max`
 * entries off the front is enough to keep the newest `max` sessions without a separate
 * timestamp field. Re-remembering an existing session id first deletes it so it moves to the
 * back, i.e. counts as freshly seen rather than ageing out at its original position.

/**
 * The SessionStart hook's entire job: make sure *some* daemon of ours is reachable before the
 * session's first request hits it, without ever being the reason a session fails to open.
 *
 * Four states, cheapest first:
 *  - "healthy": the probe says a daemon of ours is already up. One probe, no process spawn.
 *  - "disarmed" (foreign): the probe finds a server on the port that isn't ours. A stranger
 *    there would receive every session's auth header and prompt if left "healthy" - settings
 *    already points Claude Code at this port, so the patch comes back out rather than routing
 *    traffic at whatever that is.
 *  - "revived": the probe says dead, `startDaemon` brings one up. This is the common case right
 *    after a reboot, before launchd's own keep-alive has had a chance to restart it.
 *  - "disarmed" (dead): `startDaemon` itself throws (port stolen by something else, a spawn that
 *    never came up). Nothing left to retry, so the settings patch comes back out - a session
 *    that starts against a dead proxy URL would otherwise hang or error on every single request,
 *    which is strictly worse than just running plain Claude Code for this and future sessions.
 *
 * The whole function is wrapped in one outer try/catch that resolves "healthy" on anything
 * unexpected: a hook is supposed to protect the session, so the one thing it must never do is
 * reject or throw and take the session down with it. Bookkeeping (`rememberSession`) gets its
 * own inner try/catch for the same reason, scoped narrowly enough that a bookkeeping failure
 * can't quietly turn a real "revived"/"disarmed" result into a misleading "healthy" one.
